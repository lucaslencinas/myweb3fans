# myweb3fans - Near Subs

Hackathon Project for Near IRL Lisbon hackathons 2022
Platform to connect content creators to fans through web3

Project Subscription: https://devpost.com/software/near-subs

In order to publish a book, we store the file data using web3.storage and IPFS. And for the file metadata we used Moralis. When subscribing to an author, we use Roketo to create a stream between the user's wallet and the author's wallet. In order to add more personalization, we use Mintbase.io to know if the fan and the authors have had a previous interaction. For example, if the fan has gotten an NFT from the author through Mintbase
